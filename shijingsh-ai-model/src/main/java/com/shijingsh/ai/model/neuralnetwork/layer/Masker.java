/**
 * 掩盖器(本质为Dropout)
 *
 * <pre>
 * 说明
 * Note 1: As per all IDropout instances, dropout is applied at training time only - and is automatically not applied at test time (for evaluation, etc)
 * Note 2: Care should be taken when setting lower (probability of retaining) values for (too much information may be lost with aggressive (very low) dropout values).
 * Note 3: Frequently, dropout is not applied to (or, has higher retain probability for) input (first layer) layers. Dropout is also often not applied to output layers.
 * Note 4: Implementation detail (most users can ignore): DL4J uses inverted dropout.
