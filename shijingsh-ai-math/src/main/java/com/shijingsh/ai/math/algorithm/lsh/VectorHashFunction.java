/**
 * A hash function can hash a vector of arbitrary dimensions to an integer
 * representation. The hash function needs to be locality sensitive to work in
 * the locality sensitive hash scheme. Meaning that vectors that are 'close'
 * according to some metric have a high probability to end up with the same
 * hash.
